# Dynamic Asset Allocation using Machine Learning: A Sharpe Maximization Approach
### Max Cernosia, Armaan Pruthi

In this project we explore a machine learning approach to dynamic asset allocation between two risky assets, a market stock and bond index. Using a MLP the model learns to predict the optimal stock allocation proportion based on a range of relevant macroeconomic indicators and recent index return statistics. The target allocation is derived from maximizing the sharpe ratio over a rolling historical window, simulating an investor's goal of achieving the best risk-adjusted return month over month.
